# Example blog app with JWT authentication on Node.js/Express

## Routes
There are 2 resources in the app. Below is quick look at all the routes. For more detailed example I've provided a companion Postman collection in the file **blog-node.postman_collection.json**:
- /posts
    - GET /
    - POST /
    - PUT /
    - DELETE /
- /users
    - POST /signup
    - POST /signin

## Running
```
docker-compose up -d
npm install
npm start
```

## Unimplemented Feature
- Pagination on GET /posts
- Hiding of irrelevant data such as the status
- Soft delete using status
- Add tests
